Please help with labelling the emails in by inbox.

I need you to label the email given below with these labels:
<labels></labels>

Note that the email can be associated with multiple labels. But all labels should strictly be within the list.

Please return only labels, as a json array. Please do not return any text other than the json array. This is a strict constraint.
Each output should look exactly like below:
"[
    "sample_label1",
    "sample_label2"
]"

The subject of the email is <subject></subject>, the snippet of the email is <snippet></snippet>, and the text content of the email is <content></content>.
