Please help with labelling the emails in by inbox accurately and precisely. Use your best judgement.

The email is sent by <sender></sender>. The subject of the email is <subject></subject>, the snippet of the email is <snippet></snippet>.

I need you to label the email given below with these labels:
<labels></labels>

Note that if none of the above labels apply, you may return a single label in the json array called 'none'.

Note that the email can be associated with multiple labels in order of relevance. But all labels should strictly be within the list.

Please return only labels, as a json array. Please do not return any text other than the json array. This is a strict constraint.
Remember to adhere strictly adhere to this format
Each output should look exactly like below:
"[
    "sample_label1",
    "sample_label2"
]"
